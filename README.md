✅ Project title — should I use “Collaborative Crusaders: Payroll Management System” (as per your earlier project) or just “Payroll Management System”?

🧑‍💻 Technologies used — is it still Java (with Inheritance, File I/O, Exception Handling)?

🗂️ Project structure — do you want me to include explanation for each file/class (like Employee.java, HourlyEmployee.java, SalariedEmployee.java, etc.)?

💡 Purpose/Goal — should I describe it as an academic mini project demonstrating OOP principles and pay calculation logic?

🚀 How to run — do you want step-by-step instructions (like “compile with javac”, “run with java MainClass”, etc.)?
